            <h1>Notes from Week 06</h1>
            <h3>WDD 330 Web Development II </h3>
        </div>

        <h3>Chapter 14: HTML APIs Completed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Attribute:  it is used to store data in from web pages html. (The data attribute only saves information for its local use.)</li>
            <li>Two parts of an attribute: Name and Value </li>
            <li>Web Storage APIs are used mostly to store information about the user and storing application -specific information. It can also help you to use geolocation, hardware, etc.</li>
            <li>Local Storage: is a native object that has many properties and methods to store data </li>
            <li>In my own words: localStorage serves a provisional data base that works on the browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Geolocation API</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is used to obtain the location of a device using the Navigator object</li>
            <li>The method that will give you the position is called getCurrentPosition()</li>
            <li>Notes: I always wanted to know how to ask the user for permission on notifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Example:<br>
        if(window.Notification) {<br>
            Notification.requestPermission()<br>
            .then((permission) => {<br>
            if(Notification.permission === 'granted') {<br>
            new Notification('Hello JavaScript!');<br>
        }<br>
        </p>
        <p>This will ask the user for permission to show alerts or notification on the browser</p>

        <h3>Multimedia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 introduce the audio and video tag to insert that type of content on the web.</li>
            <li>Controls can be added it by adding the “controls” property, by doing this we can manipulate the videos.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ch12: Canvas, SVG and Drag and Drop</h3>
        <p>Canvas: is a space that is used to draw graphics. The use of canvas is only possible with using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>It is possible to draw lines, shapes and even images and videos on canvas.</p>
        <p>Note: It’s important to specify the width and height in the canvas tag an example will be:</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"><br>
                Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.<br>
            /canvas<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The reason why we don’t declare the width and the height in CSS is because on CSS it determines how large would be the canvas coordinate system.
        -We are not limited to squares or rectangles to create other shapes for canvas we use paths
        Paths: will set a list of points, to connect them a draw a different shape

        </p>

        <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is an API that we can use to make our webpage more dynamic with the user. And is the Drag and drop. This means that it allows you to drag files </li>
            <li>Important Steps:</li>
            <li>Add the draggable attribute and set it equal to True</li>
            <li>Dragover and drop</li>
            <li>Add the prevent default, so it lets the program to execute the functions as planned</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Part 2</h2><hr>

        <h3>Introduction to functions, execution, contexts, and call stack and How to Understand Callbacks & Higher Order Functions Videos Completed.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> JavaScript reads the code line by line - I think this is one of the most important things to remember. When we understand that JavaScript codes are read line by line. It was interesting this time to see how the programming works. Not so much on the programmer's side but how computers interpret our code and execute it. Without a doubt, learning about this helps us develop our logic when solving problems.</li>
            <li>Variables are spaces in the global memory that store a specific value or are undefined.</li>
            <li>Functions: are meant perform a specific action, they use variables that are declared inside the function or in the global memory. They follow an order of instructions "remembering the values of the variables" to create an output.</li>
            <li>Execution: when the functions are called. But it is actually the process of jumping back an forth to the global memory to use the variables and perform an action that will bring an specific value</li>
            <li>A local memory (Variable environment) where anything defined in the function is moved:  At the end, we have to keep track or our function calls to keep track of the values and to return a correct result.</li>
            <li>Call Stacks: Keeps the order starting from the global environment on how each function was called. This process helps us to have an order and a way to keep track of the value of the variables.</li>
            <li>Note: "When I have these foundational pieces built out with clarity, and completeness. All the hard parts follow more naturally." I think that is true now that I saw this video my way of thinking about code has changed, and I think I am going to be able to read the code in a similar way as the computer would do it.</li>
        </ul>
       

        <h3>Extra from How to Understand Callbacks & Higher Order Functions (Video)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I think the key is to follow the call stack to keep track of the value in the memories (local and global) and creating a new result.</li>
            <li>It goes first to the global memory where functions and variable are saved, then Is in the local memory where variables are stored (First Array == Argument) in the example of Diving by 2 each element of the first the array and after executing the function, it creates an array and continue to push the output for each element (Second array).</li>
        </ul>
