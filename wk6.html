        <h2>Kevin Pena Final Project</h2>
        <h3>Description of our App:</h3>
        <p>Our MovieApp is a dynamic website-application that can provide you with the best movies as well as provide useful information to know which movies to watch or share. Our application gives you the option to choose at the beginning (Just like Netflix) But it also offers you the opportunity to search for a specific movie. At the top is a search bar that allows you to enter the name of the movie you are looking for. By pressing the search button our application shows a list of movies that begin with the phrase or word that you have entered.
        Once when choosing the movie, you click on it and it redirects you to another specific page where it shows you useful information such as: A cover image, a short description, ratings (Example: Rotten Tomatoes), duration of the movies, main actors, etc. The objective is to be able to have an idea and special information that will help you decide and learn more about the movies.
        What were you responsible for?</p>
        <p>I was in charge of styling the CSS page and getting closer to the wireframe we made, including the color palette and making our page fully responsive and able to be used on at least 3 electronic devices. Desktop, Tablet, Smart Phone. On the other hand, I also had the opportunity to add certain animations such as the Hover in some elements.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Features used:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Media query: To make the page responsive.</li>
            <li>Hover: To change the color of the search button.</li>
            <li>Hover on movies: Once the mouse is over the element it displays a small message.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, also prepare the header and footer so that they are dynamic and autogenerated in the subpages of the application.</p>
       
       <h3>What Problems did you have and how did you resolve them?</h3> 
        <p> One of the problems we had was with the paths and updating the correct path for each of the pages. Sometimes the header and footer were not visible because the address was wrong. We were able to solve it in team and investigating outside. In this problem Marcus was the one who got the answer.<br>
            <h4>Topics and what we did as Team Project</h4>
            I could say that in our final project we saw the most important topics such as: creating dynamic pages, using external information through APIs, good handling of CSS, importing and exporting files, etc. We were able to complete a functional application between each of the team members.
