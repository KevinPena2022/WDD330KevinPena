        <h3>Ch11: Further Functions Completed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions are “First class objects” They can have methods and properties.</li>
            <li>We can call other functions using the call()method. Null should be passed as the first argument.</li>
            <li>We can add many properties to a function as we can do it with and object.</li>
        </ul>
   
        <h4>Functions can be call immediately</h4>
        <p>
            Example of syntaxis:<br>
        (function() {<br>
            // Code that runs in your function<br>
            let userAge = 23;<br>
            let currentYear = 2022;<br>
            let born = currentYear - userAge;<br>
            console.log(born);<br>
        })()<br>
    </p>

        -You can add as many as you want inside the same function, they will be performed and the order they were declared
        -Function that Define and Rewrite themselves 
        - Depending on the order you call it, Functions can rewrite themselves.
        <h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
        -	This have been one of the hardest topics for me “Recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met”. An example can be “Calculating the factorial of a number”
        Promises
        -	The future result of a function. On the other hand, promises are a good practice to handle results / errors it can take positive results and when things don’t as expect it can handle the errors.
        <h3>Function Scope - Closures</h3>
        -	We can create inner functions inside a function. These functions have access to all variables even the ones outside the function where they were called.
        <h3>Ch8. Transforms and Transitions Completed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The transform property is used the add the following effects to element in css3: translate, rotate, scale and skew. </li>
            <li>In my words “transform” is a like a class containing 4 functions.</li>
            <li>Translation: Moves the element using the x and Y axis </li>
            <li>Scaling: It allows you to increase or decrease the size of an element proportionally </li>
            <li>Rotation: It allows you to rotate the element by specifying the angle value. Example : </li>
            <li>transform: rotate(10deg)</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Transitions:</h3>
        <p>The transitions make the changes visible over time can be seconds even minutes.</p>
        <p>webkit is use so older browser cand support the transitions properties.</p>
 
        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <p>“Animations allow you to control each step of the animation via keyframes”</p>
        <p>In order to create an animation, we need keyframes. </p>

        <p> @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { </p>
            <p>/* put animation keyframes here */</p>
        <p>}</p> 
        <p>
            @keyframes myAnimation { <br>
                /* put animation keyframes here */<br>
            }
        </p>

        <p>You need to use the webkit to make it available in older browsers</p>
        <p>Keyframes contain a name and then in the body the animation.</p>
        
        <p>Note: I have to be careful naming animations, The words: forwards, running, or alternate are key terms in CSS.</p>


        
        <h3>Benefits of using transforms, transition and animations:</h3>
        <p>It makes our websites more dynamic.</p>
         <p>It improves the user experience.</p>

         <h2>Notes Part 2</h2>
         <h3>Getting Started with JSON Web Tokens Complete:</h3>
         
        <h4>What is JSON Web Token?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Is a compact standard that is used to share and transmits information in a safe way.</li>
            <li> JSON Web Tokens are most use for two things: Authentication (an example could be a log in to an account) and Information exchange (This helps to securely exchange information to one another. Some examples could be banks, schools, government jobs).
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The main three parts of the JWT are:</h4>
        <p>-Header (Two parts: the type and the hashing algorithm)
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: 
        {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT"
        }
        </p>
        

        <h4>Payload (There are three types of claims: Reserved, Public and Private)</h4>

        <p>
            
        Example:
        {
        "sub": "1234567890",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "admin": true
        }
        </p>

        <h4>Signatures.</h4>

        <h4>How JSON Web Tokens Work?</h4>
        <p>Note: A good practice is not to store data for a long time in the browser storage because of lack of security.</p>
        
        <h4>How JSON Web Tokens Work on my own words:</h4>
        <p>The browser makes the request, the server sends a Web Token, The Computer Sends a JWT on the authorization header. Finally, the server checks the signatures and sends the information to the client.
            In my opinion we just have to be careful with specifying the parts of the of the JSON Web Tokens.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Question: How is Cyber security involved on JSON Web Tokens.?</h4>

        <h4>Develop, Debug and Learn Completed</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>On the learning phase is important to experiment, even when our work does not look professional it help us to refine our techniques. Practice, Practice and Practice.</li>
            <li>We should always think on the end users. We should make their life easier, We need to help them to use tools that are going to help them.</li>
        </ul>
